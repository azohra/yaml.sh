# YAML support

YAML.sh accepts the syntax below. The parser boundaries section names nearby forms it rejects.

## Collections

- Nested block mappings using space indentation.
- Block sequences in indented and indentationless styles.
- Single-line flow sequences and mappings.
- Multiline flow sequences and mappings.
- Expanded and flow mappings inside sequences.
- Empty flow mappings (`{}`) and sequences (`[]`).
- Duplicate mapping-key rejection.
- Scalar explicit keys using `? key` followed by `: value`.

## Scalars

- Plain, single-quoted, and double-quoted scalars.
- YAML double-quoted escapes, including `\x`, `\u`, and `\U` code points.
- Multiline plain and quoted scalar folding.
- Literal (`|`) and folded (`>`) block scalars.
- Strip (`-`), clip, and keep (`+`) chomping behavior for common block scalars.
- Explicit block-scalar indentation indicators from 1 through 9.
- Lexical recognition of strings, nulls, booleans, binary/octal/decimal/hexadecimal integers, floats, and timestamps.

Scalar values print as text in default output. Recognized types also drive numeric evaluation, JSON output, patches, schema validation, and the `type` operator.

## Anchors, aliases, and merges

- Backward scalar, mapping, and sequence aliases.
- Anchors scoped to one document.
- Anchor redefinition for later aliases.
- Merge keys from one mapping alias.
- Inline merge sequences such as `<<: [*first, *second]`.
- Block merge sequences.
- Flow mapping merge sources.
- Explicit-key precedence over merged keys.
- First-source precedence within merge sequences.
- Undefined, forward, recursive, and non-mapping merge-source validation.

Aliases retain node identity internally. JSON and normal value output resolve aliases to their target content.

## Tags and directives

- `%YAML` directives, with duplicates and malformed versions rejected.
- `%TAG` directives and handle expansion.
- Standard `!!` tags.
- Verbatim tags such as `!<tag:example.com,2026:widget>`.
- Local and application tags on scalar and collection nodes.
- `--tag` inspection using the expanded tag value.

YAML version directives are validated but do not switch between complete YAML 1.1 and YAML 1.2 schema resolvers. Application tags are metadata; YAML.sh does not run constructors or create language-specific objects.

## Streams and source details

- Blank lines and comments.
- Inline comments outside quoted and flow content.
- LF and CRLF input.
- Multiple documents using `---` and `...`.
- Empty explicit documents represented as null.
- Exact source lines and columns for block and multiline flow values and keys; generated nodes report 0.
- Anchor, alias, tag, scalar/collection style, and value/key head, line, and foot comments available to queries and setters.

## Parser boundaries

- Aliases must refer to an earlier anchor in the same document.
- Recursive alias graphs are rejected.
- Anchor names may contain Unicode and punctuation except whitespace and flow delimiters.
- Collection-valued mapping keys are rejected. Explicit scalar keys are supported.
- Tags and anchors before scalar keys are accepted, but mapping keys remain text in the graph.
- Full YAML 1.1/1.2 schema resolution and application-specific construction are not implemented.

Malformed directives, reserved indicators, malformed escapes, indentation errors, invalid aliases, invalid merge sources, duplicate keys, and unsupported complex keys fail before producing a document graph.

Expression behavior belongs in the [query reference](queries.md); emitted YAML belongs in [output and metadata](output.md); edit preservation belongs in [documents and file edits](documents.md).
